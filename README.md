User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to change my password.
- As a user, I want to be able to log-out so my information is private.
- As a user, I want to be able to view an index of shows in my area
- As a user, I want to know the date, start and end time of any given show - in the index, or in my list

Development Process:
I was pretty excited about this project. I liked being able to create something that would potentially use myself in every day life. Being a big fan of music, having one place to see all of the music I am interested in seeing would be great. To keep the scale small starting out, I only included the upcoming shows for one venue I frequent, but with more time, hope to add more information, such as multiple venues, genre of music, and cost of tickets.

My original plan was to have the back end started and tested by Day 2, front end and javascript worked on Day 3+4, have everything working together flawlessly by Day 5, and spend Day 6 deploying, setting up this readme and working on the visual aspect.

I began filling out the back-end, using some examples from class and information from a past project, tic-tac-toe for the authentication for sign-in features. I made good progress and mostly stuck to my schedule for the continuation of the project time, but got stuck the night of Day 5 and spent most of day 6 fixing that bug.
